```
- Learned Java Generics to ensure type safety and improve code reusability.
- Understood the purpose of Type Parameters (`T`, `E`, `K`, `V`) in generic programming.
- Implemented Generic Classes and Generic Methods for flexible designs.
- Applied Bounded Types using `extends` and `super` to restrict type usage.
- Used Wildcards (`?`, `? extends`, `? super`) for handling flexible collections.
- Followed Generics best practices such as avoiding raw types and maintaining readable code.

### 🗓 Day 23 – Java Collections Framework (List, Set, Queue & Map)
**(Date: 17-Jan-2026)**

- Studied the architecture and hierarchy of the Java Collections Framework.
- Understood the roles of `Collection` and `Map` interfaces.
- Learned the **List Interface** and its implementations:
  - `ArrayList`
  - `LinkedList`
  - `Vector`
- Practiced common List operations:
  - Adding, removing, updating, and searching elements
  - Iteration using for-each loop, Iterator, and ListIterator
- Learned the **Set Interface** and its implementations:
  - `HashSet`
  - `LinkedHashSet`
  - `TreeSet`
- Understood how Sets handle uniqueness, ordering, and sorting.
- Learned the **Map Interface** and its implementations:
  - `HashMap`
  - `LinkedHashMap`
  - `TreeMap`
- Performed key-value operations:
  - Insertion, deletion, and retrieval of entries
  - Iteration using `entrySet()`, `keySet()`, and `values()`
- Learned the **Queue Interface** and its implementations:
  - `PriorityQueue`
  - `ArrayDeque`
- Practiced queue operations:
  - Enqueue, dequeue, peek, and poll
- Understood FIFO behavior and priority-based processing.
- Studied internal working, real-time use cases, and performance considerations.
- Practiced practical examples using List, Set, Queue, and Map.
- Committed and pushed all changes.

### 🗓 Day 24 – Java I/O Streams
**(Date: 19-Jan-2026)**

- Studied the architecture of Java I/O Streams and stream-based data processing.
- Covered both Byte Streams and Character Streams for file handling.
- Learned and implemented:
  - `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`
  - `FileReader`, `FileWriter`
  - `BufferedInputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`
  - `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`
- Understood Object Streams including:
  - `ObjectInputStream`, `ObjectOutputStream`
  - Serialization and deserialization concepts
- Practiced working with in-memory streams:
  - `ByteArrayInputStream`, `ByteArrayOutputStream`
- Used bridge streams for character encoding:
  - `InputStreamReader`, `OutputStreamWriter`
- Applied best practices such as buffering and try-with-resources.
- Solved practical problems like file copy, serialization, and efficient large-file reading.
- Committed and pushed all work.

### 🗓 Day 25 – Exception Handling
**(Date: 20-Jan-2026)**

- Studied Java exception handling concepts and exception hierarchy.
- Differentiated between checked and unchecked exceptions.
- Implemented exception handling using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and multiple catch blocks.
- Practiced handling common runtime exceptions.
- Used nested `try-catch` blocks for detailed error handling.
- Applied `throw` and `throws` for exception creation and propagation.
- Designed custom exceptions for business rule enforcement.
- Used try-with-resources for automatic resource management.
- Solved scenario-based exception handling problems.
- Committed and pushed all work.
