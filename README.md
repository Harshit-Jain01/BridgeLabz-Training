### 📅 Day 3 – Java Inbuilt Keywords (`this`, `static`, `final`, `instanceof`)
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**

- Learned and understood the purpose and usage of Java inbuilt keywords: this, static, final, and instanceof
- Used the this keyword to resolve ambiguity between instance variables and constructor parameters and to support constructor chaining
- Implemented static variables and methods for shared data, utility functions, and memory-efficient class-level behavior
- Applied the final keyword to create constants, prevent reassignment, restrict method overriding, and stop class inheritance
- Used the instanceof operator for safe type-checking before casting objects in polymorphic scenarios
- Developed and verified real-world programs including Bank Account System, Library Management System, Employee Management System, and Shopping Cart System
