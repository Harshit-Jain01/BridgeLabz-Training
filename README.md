- Worked with complex queries:
  - Subqueries & correlated subqueries  
  - EXISTS and derived tables
- Learned advanced SQL concepts:
  - Window functions  
  - CTE and recursive CTE  
  - Transactions and isolation levels
- Studied indexing:

### 🗓 Day 35 – JDBC Fundamentals & Database Connectivity  
**(Date: 09-Feb-2026)**
- Studied JDBC architecture and workflow.
- Learned core JDBC components:
  - `DriverManager`, `Connection`, `Statement`
  - `PreparedStatement`, `CallableStatement`, `ResultSet`
- Established MySQL database connection using JDBC driver.
- Implemented CRUD operations:
  - INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Compared `Statement` vs `PreparedStatement` and learned SQL injection prevention.
- Practiced ResultSet processing and data retrieval.
- Learned transaction management concepts:
  - Auto-commit, commit, rollback, savepoints
- Followed JDBC best practices:
  - Try-with-resources
  - Proper exception handling
  - Secure query execution
- Introduced DAO and DTO design patterns for database applications.
- Solved JDBC practice programs and committed all work.
